RANDOM MODULE 
import random as r
x= "i love u "
print(r. sample(x,3))# prints any three chars

a=[1,2,3,4,5]
r.shuffle(a)
print(a)# prints shuffled list only for list 

print(r.choice(a))
b="hello world"
print(r.choice(a))
print(r.choice(b)) #prints  random char  in list or string  only one unlike sample


c=r.random()
print(c) 
print(r.randint(20,30))#gives int random

print(r.choices(a,k=3))# default k  now works like sample
#print(r.choices(a,k=10))
print(r.choices(b,k=10))

print(r.uniform(20,30))#gives float randomly

y=dir(r)
print(y)#gives all functions in modules
    FUNCTIONS
 classifications 
1. pre defined 
2. user defined 
 for code re useability we use functions let's say we want to use particular function multiple times in our
 prgm instead of
 writting  the same code multiple times  we can  write it once include that inside a function and can call the function where ever 
 we need it
  TYPES 
 functions without argument and without written value 
 functions without argument with return value 
 function with argument and with return value 
 function with argument   and without return 
    RECURSIVE FUNCTION
 a function which calls itself is known as recurisve function
concept called recursion
