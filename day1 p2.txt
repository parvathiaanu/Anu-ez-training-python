LAMBDA FUNCTION:
lambda function is  called as anonymous function  when we want to function concept without using 
function name there we apply concept of lamba function


OOPS
4 pillars of opps:
ABSTRACTION: Hiding the implementation part showing what is requried forthe users 
             example :exe file 
             we can make class or method as abstract ,opposite to abstract is concrete 
ENCAPSULATION:
             PUBLIC:one class  info can be accesed by any other class
             PRIVATE:can be used where it is declared(no inherintance class)
             PROTECTED: can be accesed only where it is declared whichever class declared from this also can be accesed
             example:
               a=public
              __b=private ,double underscores
              _c=protected ,single underscores
INHERTIANCE: base or main class and derived class
             example base is parent class, derived class is child class
             DERIVED CLASS WILL INHERIT THE PROPERTIES OF BASE CLASS
        TYPES:
          Single , mutiple ,multi-level,hirerchal,hybrid inheritance
