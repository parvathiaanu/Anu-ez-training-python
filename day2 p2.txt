polymorphism

one item or same item used for different purpose 
types:
1.over loading ,
a.operator over loading : same operator for different purpose
b.method over loading:same method calling
2. over riding:if a method is defective or cannot be used or cannot be used inside dervird class it will take it from it's base or parent class.


                                                     DATA STRUCTURES
                                     HELPS TO WRITE EFFICENT PROGRAMS 
 LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR:
arrays                    
linked list
stack
queue
matrix are linear 
.......non linear  non sequential style requried 
STATIC AND DYNAMIC:
list stack and queue are  dynamic:size is not fixed 
arrays are static: size is fixed 
LINKEDLIST:as the name says the items  linked with another like a train 
types: single ,double,circular
every data in linked list is reffered as node and it will have two segments (i.e data and address)
last node alwats has zero as add res
CREATING A LINKED LIST:
step1: create the node
step2:partition the node with two segments data and none
step3: add value into the blank node 
step 4: mark the node as head 
step5: create thenext node  by folloeing the adove steps 
step6: eatablish link between first node and the second node

DISPLAY ING LINKED LIST:
traversal is requried from the first node till tail node inorder to display exisiting linked list.
